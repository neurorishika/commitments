# Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion


## Statement of Commitment

As a member of the scientific community, I, *Rishika Mohanta*, am committed to creating a diverse, equitable, and inclusive environment for all. **I am committed to creating a safe space and being an active advocate for all people, regardless of their sex, gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity, class, background, religion, and/or physical/mental disabilities.**  I will strive to create a welcoming environment for all people, especially those who are underrepresented in the scientific community. 

I will actively seek out opportunities to learn about diversity, equity, and inclusion and will work to incorporate these principles into my daily life and work. I will actively listen to and support the voices of those who are not in the majority and will work to amplify their voices. I will strive to be an ally to all people and will work to dismantle systems of oppression in my immediate environment and in the scientific community at large. 

I shall not tolerate any form of discrimination, harassment, or abuse and will take action to prevent, report, and address such behavior, especially as a bystander. I will not stand by and watch but will take immediate action. I will not be afraid to speak up and will not be afraid to reach out to help. 

Further, I will keep an open mind to any and all feedback. I will admit my mistakes and take responsibility for my actions. I will not retaliate in any form if my actions or lack thereof are called into question. I will strive to be a better person and will work to improve my own behavior and actions at all times.

If I fail to live up to these standards, you can hold me accountable by anonymously reporting any violations of my commitment below.
