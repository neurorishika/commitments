# Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion

## Introduction

This page is a collection of resources that I have found useful in my journey to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in academia. 

## Disclaimer
The website is still under construction, so please excuse the mess. I will be adding more content as I go along and hopefully, if I start a lab in the future, this will be a useful resource for my trainees.
