# Inclusivity guidelines to enforce in safe spaces

## Introduction

In order to create a safe space, it is important to have a set of guidelines that define acceptable behavior. These guidelines should be enforced by the moderators of the space. The guidelines should be clear and concise, and should be enforced consistently. The guidelines should be reviewed periodically to ensure that they are still relevant and appropriate. The guidelines should be made available to all participants in the space.

## Guidelines

Find below a list of guidelines that can be used to create a safe space. These guidelines are not exhaustive, and you may want to add or remove some of them. You may also want to add guidelines that are specific to your space. These are the guidelines that I use in spaces that I moderate.

### General guidelines

- Anyone can participate in the space, regardless of their background, identity, or level of experience and will be treated with equal respect.

- No one can be forced to reveal their identity or background, and no one can be forced to participate in the any discussion. If someone does not want to interact or discuss a particular topic, they should be allowed to opt out, and their decision should be respected.

- All members must respect each others’ identities and backgrounds. No one should be made to feel uncomfortable or unwelcome because of their identity or background.

- All members should address others by their preferred names and pronouns, and should not assume that they know what these are. If someone does not know what someone’s preferred name or pronouns are, they should ask. If a mistake is made, the person who made the mistake should apologize and correct themselves. If someone is repeatedly misgendered or misnamed, they are allowed to correct the person who is misgendering or misnaming them. If someone refuses to correct themselves, they will be asked to leave the space and will be reported to the appropriate authorities, if necessary.

- No information regarding members’ identities and personal life (including photographs) should be divulged to others without clear consent from the member(s) concerned

- All members must respect every individual’s comfort with explicit language/media/actions etc. or lack thereof and provide necessary trigger warnings whenever possible. Often times, people who are marginalized are more likely to be triggered by certain topics or language. If someone is triggered by a particular topic or language, they should be allowed to opt out of the discussion. Alternatively, the conversation should be moved to a private conversation or a different space.

- No form of racism, sexism, queerphobia, hate speech, bigotry, discrimination, or any such speech or actions that might hinder other members’ participation in the space or be an affront to their dignity will be allowed. 

- No form of sexual harassment, sexual assault, or any other form of sexual misconduct will be tolerated. If someone is found to be engaging in such behavior, they will be asked to leave the space immediately and will be reported to the appropriate authorities, if necessary.

## Protocol for reporting violations and resolving conflicts

There should be a clear protocol for reporting violations of the guidelines and should be made available to all members of the space. The following is the protocol that I shall follow:

### Reporting violations

Violations of the guidelines can be reported to me by filling out the [anonymous violation report](https://forms.gle/pXiTecCNVq1dPgPk6). The form will be reviewed by me.


## Resolving conflicts

#### Stage 1: Understanding the conflict

I will attempt to resolve the conflict by talking to the person(s) who violated the guidelines to get their side of the incident. If there is a discrepancy between the reported incident and the individual(s) story, a subsequent meeting will be held with the those witness of the violation or who were targeted in the incident. Once a complete picture of the incident has been understood, a decision will be made on how to proceed based on a incident report filled out by me. 

A copy of the incident report will be sent to the person(s) who violated the guidelines and the person(s) who were targeted in the incident and they will both get one opportunity to respond to the incident report within a working day which will be added to the incident report.

#### Stage 2: Warning or Removal

If the violation is a minor infraction, I will ask the person(s) who violated the guidelines to apologize and to refrain from repeating the violation. This will be documented in the file for the individual(s) concerned as a warning. If the similar violations are reported in the future, the individual(s) will be asked to leave the space after the second warning i.e. the third violation. 

If the violation is a major infraction, the appropriate authorities (e.g. the human resources department) will be notified. An external senior advisor (senior faculty member / senior staff member) and any available diversity and inclusion officer will be consulted to determine the appropriate course of action. If the violation is found to be a major infraction by the other parties, the individual(s) will be asked to leave the space immediately. 

If the violation is a criminal offense, the police will be notified and the person will be asked to leave the space immediately.

#### Stage 3: Follow-up

I will follow up with the targeted individual(s) to ensure that they are safe and that they are not being harassed by the individual(s) who violated the guidelines after the incident at regular intervals (e.g. at three days, one week, one month, and three months after the incident). If the targeted individual(s) are being harassed by the individual(s) who violated the guidelines, the individual(s) who violated the guidelines will be asked to leave the space immediately.

## Documenting the incident

Documenting the incident and the resolution of the incident is important for the safety of the targeted individual(s) and the individual(s) who violated the guidelines. The incident reports will be kept on file and in a digital archive for future reference. The incident reports will be kept confidential and will only be shared with the targeted individual(s) and the individual(s) who violated the guidelines.
