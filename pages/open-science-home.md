# Open and Ethical Science

## Statement of Commitment


## Introduction

Here is a collection of resources that I have found useful in my journey to promote open and ethical science.

## Disclaimer
The website is still under construction, so please excuse the mess. I will be adding more content as I go along and hopefully, if I start a lab in the future, this will be a useful resource for my trainees.
