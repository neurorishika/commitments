# Welcome to Neurorishika's Commitments and Resources Page!

This page is a collection of *commitments* and *standards* that I have set for myself. I hope that this page will be a useful resource for you as well. The website is still under construction, so please excuse the mess. I will be adding more content as I go along and hopefully, if I start a lab in the future, this will be a useful resource for my trainees.
