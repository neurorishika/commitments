# Welcome to Neurorishika's Resources

![Neurorishika](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neurorishika/resources/main/assets/images/profilecard.png)

This page is a collection of *commitments* and *standards* that I have set for myself along with the resources that I have used to create them. I hope that this page will be a useful resource for you as well. Feel free to use the resources on this page for personal use or for your own lab, group, or organization with appropriate attribution.

## Core Values

I have a few core values that I try to live by. These values are not always easy to live by, but I try my best to do so. I hope that these values will be be good guiding principles for you as well.

### [Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion](/resources/dei-home)

I value having a diverse community of individuals around me. I believe that diversity is a strength and that we can learn from each other. I believe that we should strive to create an equitable environment where everyone has equal opportunity to succeed, and where everyone feels safe and welcome.

### [Open and Ethical Science](/resources/open-science-home)

I believe that science should be open and accessible to everyone. I believe that science should be reproducible and for that we should strive to make the scientific process and the results as transparent as possible. I also believe that we should strive to make the entire scientific process ethically motivated and that we should strive to make science a force for good by minimizing use of resources and maximizing the impact of our work.

### [Individual Growth and Professional Development](/resources/individual-growth-home)

Each of us is unique and we all have our own strengths and weaknesses. I strive to recognize the strengths of each individual and their potential to grow and develop, irrespective of their background or career stage. I believe that we should strive to be lifelong learners and that we should strive to be better people every day.

### [Good Experimental Design and Analysis](/resources/experimental-design-home)

I believe that good experimental design is the foundation of good science. I believe that we should strive to design experiments that are as simple and unbiased as possible while still being able to answer the question at hand. I also believe that this can be achieved by using a combination of the use of theoretical models to guide the experimental design, use of minimal controls, and smart and appropriate statistical analysis.

### [Collaboration and Networking](/resources/collaboration-home)

I believe that collaboration is the key to success. I believe that we can achieve more by working together than by working alone. I believe that we should strive to create an environment where everyone feels comfortable to share their ideas and opinions and where everyone feels that they belong and are valued. Further, I believe that everyone should learn the skills needed to network in the scientific community and to collaborate with others.

### [Remembering the Big Picture](/resources/big-picture-home)

Often, we get so caught up in the details of our work that we forget to take a step back and look at the big picture. I believe that we should strive to remember the big picture and to keep in mind the ultimate goal of our work. In other words, even in our search for 'what' and 'how', we should not forget the 'why' (Niko Tinbergen's Four Questions).
